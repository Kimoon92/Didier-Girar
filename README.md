The concept of blockchain is simple: a scalable and globally consistent database that maintains a growing list of ordered records.

Using [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/) and [Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/)
it is possible to build a basic blockchain in 200 lines of code.

Pull requests are welcome.
